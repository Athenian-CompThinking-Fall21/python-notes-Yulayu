# Python Notes

Use this repository (repo, for short) to practice skills as we work on them in class. There are several .py files, and you are welcome to add more.

### Files
* [print/input](src/print_input.py)
  * printing messages, getting inputs from the user and combining those skills to create an interactive program
* [variable practice](src/variables.py)
  * data types, working with strings, mathematical operations
* [functions](src/functions.py)
  * defining, writing and calling your own functions 
* [if statements & booleans](src/if_statements.py)
  * boolean values and conditions, if-elif-else blocks 
* [for loops](src/for_loops.py)
* [while loops](src/while_loops.py)
* [lists](src/lists.py) 


### Submitting your Repo
* When you have completed each task, commit and push to GitHub.
* Go to the repo on GitHub and click on the Pull Requests tab. Look for feedback about style. If any issues are found, fix them and check your changes in to GitHub. Repeat until no errors are found. (You can also use the style messages on PyCharm to guide you. That will decrease the number of back-and-forths from PyCharm to GitHub.)
* When done, submit "Done" on Canvas.
